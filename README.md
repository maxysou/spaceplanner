# SpacePlanner

**An interactive, to-scale planning tool for laying out any space — a garden, a room, a patio, an entire property.** Draw the boundaries of your space, drop in accurately-sized objects, and see exactly how everything fits before you move a single real-world thing.

SpacePlanner runs entirely in your browser. There's nothing to install, no account to create, and your work saves automatically on your own device.

## What it's for

SpacePlanner answers the question *"will this actually fit, and where should it go?"* — accurately, before you commit.

Everything is drawn **to scale**, so a 3 m garden bed takes up exactly three of the one-metre grid squares, and the gap you see between a shed and a fence is the real gap. Typical uses:

- Garden and landscape layout (beds, trees, paths, patios, sheds)
- Room and furniture planning
- Driveways, parking, and outdoor areas
- Any project where you need to place real, measured things in a real, measured space

It works best on a **laptop or desktop** — the canvas and side panels need room to breathe.

---

## Quick start

1. **Open the app.** You'll see a demo plot (a 10 × 7 m rectangle) on a one-metre grid.
2. **Shape your space.** Click **Edit area** and adjust the corners and side lengths to match your real space, then lock it.
3. **Add objects.** Click **Objects**, create something with real dimensions (say a 2 × 3 m patio), and place it.
4. **Position precisely.** Drag it, nudge it with the arrow keys, or type its exact distance from each wall.
5. **It's already saved.** Your layout is stored on your device automatically. Use **Export** to make a backup file you can keep or share.

That's the whole loop: *area → objects → position → done.*

---

## Core concepts

A few ideas make everything else click into place:

**Everything is to scale.** The canvas works in real-world measurements (metres and centimetres, European style). The background grid is your ruler — by default each square is one metre, and it adapts as you zoom.

**The canvas is infinite.** Pan by dragging empty space, zoom with your scroll wheel. **Fit to view** reframes everything neatly whenever you get lost.

**There are three things you work with:** *areas* (the boundaries of your spaces), *objects* (the items you place inside them), and *measurements* (a ruler for spot-checking distances). Each has its own button in the toolbar.

---

## The toolbar

Across the top:

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Edit area** | Draw and reshape the boundaries of your space(s) |
| **Objects** | Create, place, and manage the items in your space |
| **Measure** | A two-click ruler for measuring any distance |
| **↶ Undo / ↷ Redo** | Step backward or forward through your changes |
| **Fit to view** | Reframe the canvas so everything is visible |
| **Export** | Download your whole layout as a file |
| **Import** | Load a layout file back in |

## Areas — defining your space

An **area** is the boundary of a space — your garden fence line, the walls of a room, the edge of a driveway. You can have **as many areas as you like**, each with its own name and colour. For example: *Back Garden*, *House*, *Driveway*, *Front Garden* — all on the same canvas.

### Drawing an area

Click **Edit area**. You build the boundary out of **corners** (numbered 1, 2, 3…) connected by **sides** (lettered A, B, C…).

- **Add corner** drops a new corner onto the canvas.
- **Drag any corner** to shape the boundary by eye.
- **Fine-tune a corner with the arrow keys** — click a corner to select it, then tap the arrow keys to nudge it **1 cm at a time** (hold **Shift** for 10 cm). The two side lengths touching that corner update live as you go, so you can dial in exact measurements without fighting the mouse.
- **Type an exact side length** in the side list to set that wall precisely — drag to get close, then type the exact number.
- **Move the whole area** — drag anywhere on the area's fill (not a corner) to slide the entire shape at once, keeping its size and proportions intact.
- **Start from rectangle** gives you a clean four-corner box to reshape, which is the fastest start for most spaces.

> **Recommended workflow:** drag corners to rough-shape the area → type side lengths to get close → click a corner and **arrow-nudge** to finish. Because corners move freely, the side numbers don't fight each other the way they can when you set lengths alone.

> **Example — an L-shaped garden:** Start from rectangle, then add two more corners and drag them to carve out the "notch" of the L. Click each corner and arrow-nudge until every side reads exactly right.

When it matches your real space, click **🔒 Lock this area**. Locking fixes it in place so you can't nudge it by accident while placing objects. The panel then shows a summary — number of sides, bounding box, and total area in m². Click **🔓 Unlock to edit** any time to change it again.

### Multiple areas

Each area appears in the **Areas list** at the top of the panel. From there you can:

- **Switch** which area you're editing (click its row)
- **Rename** it (click the name and type)
- **Recolour** it (click the colour swatch)
- **Delete** it (🗑)
- **Add** another (**+ New area**)

Each area is filled with a soft, textured tint in its own colour so you can tell your zones apart at a glance.

---

## Objects — everything you place

An **object** is anything you put inside your space: a tree, a flower bed, a patio, a shed, a sofa, a parking spot. Objects are **circles, squares, or rectangles**, each drawn to its real size.

### Creating an object

In the **Objects** panel:

1. Give it a **name** (e.g. "Apple tree").
2. Choose a **shape** — Rectangle, Square, or Circle.
3. Enter its **dimensions** (width × length, a single side, or a diameter).
4. Pick a **colour**.
5. Click **+ Create & place** — it appears in the middle of your view, scaled correctly.

Each object shows its **name and dimensions** right on the canvas (e.g. "Apple tree · ⌀ 2 m").

### Moving and adjusting

Once an object is on the canvas:

- **Drag** its body to move it. (This works even with the Objects panel closed.)
- **Drag a corner handle** to resize it. Circles stay round.
- **Drag the handle on the stalk above** it to rotate.
- **Arrow keys** nudge the selected object **1 cm per tap** — hold **Shift** for 10 cm. Perfect for fine alignment.

### The object list

Every object appears as a row in the panel. Each row has:

- A **checkbox** (for grouping — see below)
- A **drag grip (⋮⋮)** — drag rows up and down to set **stacking order**. **Top of the list = in front**, so you control which object overlaps which.
- A **▸ expand arrow** — opens that object's detail editor
- **Duplicate (⧉)**, **Lock (🔒/🔓)**, and **Delete (🗑)**

### Editing an object's details

Click the **▸** on a selected object to open its editor, where you can change (when the object is unlocked):

- **Name** and **colour**
- **Size** — type exact dimensions
- **Position by distance** — type how far the object's centre should sit from each wall (left / right / up / down). Type "2" in the *left* box and the object jumps so its centre is exactly 2 m from the left wall.

The editor also shows a live read-out of the object's distance to each wall, and which area it's currently inside.

> **Tip:** Lock an object (🔒) once it's exactly where you want it. Locked objects can't be moved or resized by accident, but you can still see them and their distances.

---

## Distance lines

Whenever you **select an object**, four dashed lines appear, running from its centre out to the four walls of the area it sits inside — up, down, left, and right — each labelled with the real distance.

These update **live as you drag**, so you can position something by watching the numbers change. They're a fast way to answer "how far is this tree from each fence?"

A few details:

- Lines only appear when the object's centre is **inside an area**. Drag it onto open canvas and they disappear.
- Each object measures only to **its own area** — an object in the *House* never measures to the *Garden*.
- For a **group**, the lines measure from the group's overall centre (see below).

---

## Grouping objects

If several objects belong together — a cluster of plants, a table with its chairs — you can **group** them so they move as one.

1. **Tick the checkboxes** of two or more objects in the list.
2. Click **Group checked**.

Grouped objects get a small coloured **G#** badge. Now:

- **Dragging or nudging any member** moves the whole group together.
- **Clicking any member** selects the entire group.
- The **distance lines** measure from the group's overall centre to the walls.

To break a group up, tick one of its members and click **Ungroup**.

> **Example:** Group a patio table with its four chairs. Now you can shuffle the whole dining set around the patio to find the best spot, and they keep their arrangement.

---

## The Measure tool

The **Measure** tool is a free ruler for checking any distance — independent of objects.

1. Click **Measure**, then **+ New measurement**.
2. Click two points on the canvas. A red dot marks each, and the distance shows on the line.

You can place **as many measurements as you like**, and they all stay visible. Other features:

- **Snapping** — points snap to nearby area corners and object centres, so "fence corner to tree" is exact, not approximate.
- **Edit after the fact** — drag the red endpoints to reposition, or type an exact length in the measurement's box to resize it.
- **Lock (🔒)** a measurement to keep it; **Clear all** removes the unlocked ones and keeps the locked ones.
- **Delete (🗑)** removes a single measurement.
- Press **Escape** to cancel a measurement mid-placement.

> **Example:** Measure the clear path between two flower beds to check a wheelbarrow will fit — click the edge of one bed, then the other, and read the gap.

---

## Projects

You can keep several separate plans as **projects** — each with its own areas, objects, and measurements. This lets you plan your back garden, a friend's garden, and a room layout without them ever mixing.

- **Switch projects** with the dropdown at the top of the window.
- **Create, rename, or delete** projects via the **Projects** button, which opens the project manager. A new project starts as a blank canvas; rename one by editing its name in the manager.
- Projects are **saved on your device**, the same way single layouts are.

---

## Saving, sharing & backups

**Your work saves automatically** to your own browser, on your own device, every time you make a change. Close the tab, come back later, refresh the page — your projects are still there.

A few important things to understand about how this works:

- **Saving is per-device and per-browser.** Your projects live in the browser you're using. They are *not* automatically shared between computers or people.
- **To move work between devices or share it**, use **Export**. If you have more than one project, you'll be asked whether to export **just the current project** or **all projects** as a single backup file. The other person (or your other computer) opens SpacePlanner and clicks **Import** — it loads the file as a new project (or restores all of them) without overwriting anything you already have.
- **Export is also your backup.** If you ever clear your browser data or switch laptops, that file is how your work survives. It's good practice to export after a big session.

> **Sharing example:** You design a garden on your laptop and click **Export → current project**. You send the `.json` file to your partner. They open SpacePlanner, click **Import**, and it appears as a new project they can tweak and export back to you.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| **Arrow keys** | Nudge the selected object — or the selected area corner — 1 cm |
| **Shift + Arrow keys** | Nudge the selected object or area corner 10 cm |
| **Ctrl / ⌘ + Z** | Undo |
| **Ctrl / ⌘ + Y** (or **Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + Z**) | Redo |
| **Escape** | Cancel a measurement in progress |
| **Scroll wheel** | Zoom in / out |
| **Drag empty canvas** | Pan around |

## A worked example

Planning a small back garden, start to finish:

1. **Area.** Click **Edit area → Start from rectangle**. Set the sides to your real fence lengths — say 8 m × 6 m. The plot now matches your garden. Click **🔒 Lock this area** and rename it "Back Garden".
2. **Add a second zone.** Click **+ New area**, name it "Patio", give it a different colour, and shape it as a 3 × 4 m rectangle in one corner. Lock it.
3. **Place a tree.** Click **Objects**, create a circle named "Apple tree", diameter 2 m, green. Drag it into the garden. The four distance lines show how far it is from each fence.
4. **Position it exactly.** Open its editor (**▸**) and type "1.5" in the *left* box and "2" in the *up* box — it snaps to exactly 1.5 m from the left fence and 2 m from the top.
5. **Add beds.** Create a 1 × 3 m rectangle "Veg bed", duplicate it twice (⧉), and line them up using the arrow keys.
6. **Group the beds.** Tick all three veg beds, click **Group checked**. Now you can shuffle the whole set to find the sunniest spot.
7. **Check a gap.** Use **Measure** to confirm there's at least 80 cm between the beds and the patio for a wheelbarrow.
8. **Back it up.** Click **Export** and keep the file.

## Tips & good to know

- **The grid is your ruler.** By default one square = one metre; it relabels as you zoom so you always know the scale.
- **Shape an area in three moves:** drag corners to rough it out, type side lengths to get close, then click a corner and **arrow-nudge** (1 cm per tap) to finish precisely.
- **Drag the fill to move a whole area** without disturbing its shape; drag a corner to reshape it.
- **Lock things you're happy with** — both areas and objects — so you can keep working without disturbing them.
- **Stacking order = list order.** If one object is hiding behind another, drag its row to the top of the list to bring it to the front.
- **Distances are centre-based.** The four lines and the position boxes measure from an object's centre, matching each other.
- **Export early, export often.** It's a one-click backup and the only way to move a plan between devices.

## FAQ

**Do I need an account or internet connection?**
No account, ever. Once the page has loaded it works offline, and your work saves locally.

**Will my saved layout be lost when the app updates?**
No. The save format is designed to carry forward, so new features won't erase existing layouts. For total peace of mind around a big change, export a backup first.

**Why doesn't it work well on my phone?**
SpacePlanner is built for the precision of a laptop or desktop — small touchscreens don't give the canvas and panels enough room. Use it on a larger screen for the best experience.

**Can two people edit the same plan at once?**
Not live. Saving is per-device. To collaborate, take turns: one person exports the file and the other imports it.

**What units does it use?**
Metres and centimetres (European style). Distances under a metre show in cm; larger ones in m.
